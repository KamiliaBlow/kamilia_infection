# vorp_infection

- This script adds disease and infection to your server.

- To infect a player, enter the command /infection id. To cure a player, enter the /cure id command. You can also add the vaccine item so that players can heal themselves.

How does it work? 
- Every 10-30 seconds (Time you customize yourself), the character takes 5 damage
- If there is another player within the player's radius (approximately 5 units), he will also be infected.
- When the player's health drops to 150-51 The character starts coughing in between when taking damage.
- When the player's health drops to 51-5, when taking damage, the character vomits and a Deadeye effect is applied to the screen

- If a character dies, the disease is removed from them automatically
